# Maersk Supply Chain Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes Maersk's supply chain to identify inefficiencies and optimize operations. Using Python for data manipulation and Power BI for dashboards, the study focuses on inventory management, shipping operations, and customer demand. Key outputs include enhanced inventory segmentation, detailed analysis of shipment delays, and strategic recommendations for a more efficient and responsive supply chain.

## Project Description
The project aims to:
- Analyze key challenges in shipment and inventory management.
- Utilize analytical approaches to propose actionable insights.
- Enhance decision-making processes within the supply chain through robust data visualization tools.

## Methodology
### Analysis
- **Business Demand Analysis**: Create interactive dashboards to identify and address inefficiencies.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - **Python**: Data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - **Power BI**: Development of interactive dashboards.

### Stakeholder Dashboards
- **Sales Management Dashboard**: Tracks sales, profits, orders, and customer activities.
- **Inventory Management Dashboard**: Focuses on inventory status, order fulfillment, and distribution costs.
- **Shipping Management Dashboard**: Monitors shipping operations and timeliness.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Simplified datasets by removing irrelevant columns, correcting data types, and resolving data inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Introduced features to assess shipment timeliness and calculate key business metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in-depth analysis to explore:
- Business performance metrics.
- Customer demographics and buying behaviors.
- Product preferences and profitability.
- Inventory levels and management efficiency.

## Inventory Segmentation
Utilized ABC XYZ segmentation to categorize inventory based on revenue contribution and demand stability, aiding in prioritized management and optimization.

### Restoring Revenue and Profit
- **High-Demand Segments (XA, YA)**: Reintroduce high-demand segments with new suppliers and an improved supply chain design.
- **Emerging Segments (XB, XC)**: Conduct market research to explore and capitalize on the growth potential of these segments.

### Inventory Management
- **Reduce Low-Performance Segments**: Discontinue or minimize inventory in low-demand segments to optimize storage costs.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Implement advanced forecasting and reorder points to manage inventory levels effectively.

### Shipping and Handling Improvements
- **Transportation Optimization**: Redesign transportation routes to improve delivery efficiency.
- **Local Logistics Collaboration**: Partner with local logistics to enhance delivery capabilities, especially in remote markets.
- **Strategic Warehouse Placement**: Establish warehouses in strategic locations like Singapore to improve international market serviceability.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Identified trends influencing inventory and shipping.
- Suggested strategic adjustments to improve supply chain responsiveness and efficiency.
